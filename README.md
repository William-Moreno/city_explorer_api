# City Explorer API

**Author**: William Moreno
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
I build an API server, that provides data for the City Explorer Application. It will allow a user to search for a location, present a map of the location's area, and information about the chosen location. This will be accomplished using data from APIs the server will fetch and manage.

## Getting Started

Open the City Explorer site using https://city-explorer-app-wm.herokuapp.com as the server.

## Architecture

The server is constructed using Node.js
